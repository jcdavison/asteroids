    <h1>Splattering our killer asteroid with white paint is more than just fun. It harnesses the power of the Sun. The Sun emits energetic photons that hit the asteroid, forcing it to speed up. As you can see in the simulation, this alters the timing of when the asteroid crossing our path, avoiding a collision.</h1>
